PRELAB:

1. $ groups

2. The environmental variable $ contains your PATH, which looks for executables in your system. For example, using echo $SHELL 
   yields the path of the current shell being used (bash, zsh, dash, etc.), or using $(ls a) in a shell script
   allows you to use the contents of entry (ls a) in another command.

3. If you are running a process foregrounded in the shell, you can press [Ctrl + Z] to suspend the process and put into background. 
   Alternatively, you can use   $ kill [PID]   to suspend a program, then a subsequent   $ bg   command to place a recently 
   suspended process in the background.

4.$ uname -rn 
  or
  $ uname -r --nodename

  flag -r will show your kernel version + release
  flag -n, or --nodename will print the name of the network node 

5. . refers to the current directory.
 
   E.g. $ cd /foo/
        $ ls . 
   will list all of the files in foo.

   .. refers to the parent directory.
  
   E.g. $ cd /foo/bar/
        $ cd ..
    will take me to directory foo.

   ~ refers to home directory.
  
   E.g. Logged in as user elijah running foo linux.
        $ cd ~ 
        takes me to /home/elijah/

        Logged in as root running foo linux.
        $ cd ~ 
        takes me to the root directory           
   
6.  pid is short for process ID. A unique process ID is assigned to every processs when 
    it is created. There are many ways to indentify process IDs :
    
    $ htop  or  $top   is an easy way to see all sleeping, running, stopped or zombie tasks with their appropriate pid
    $ ps will show you all currently running processes with their pid on your computer  

7. $ cut -d: -f1,7 /etc/passwd
   
   flag -d :-f1,7 uses ':' as a delimeter and selects column 1 and 7 to be printed.
   
   as a result, cut prints out the name of the user, and the default shell they use seperated by a :.

8. su allows you to switch to any given user with their permissions, e.g.
  users : elijah , root , foo
  logged into elijah
  $ su foo  
  will log you into foo with all permissions of foo.

  So, using  $su root switches user to root with a shell of the permissions of 'root' 

  
  sudo allows you, given you are given the correct permissions in /etc/sudoers, to run a process as root from another user. 
  specifying sudo with flag -i allows you to drop into a new shell similar to ' su root '.
  By using  $ visudo , you can set the permissions for sudo with various options by editing /etc/sudoers, like:
 
 - the ability to run sudo with or without a password for certain users
 - the ability to run sudo with or without a password for certain users that are members of a specific group
 - the ability to run sudo on certain programs only.

9. In *nix based systems. you can use a 'cron' software to schedule specific tasks to be scheduled into certain time 
   intervals. There are many implementations of 'cron' softwares, like 'acron' or 'fcron'. Cron softwares let you schedule things 
   yearly,monthy,weekly,daily,hourly,by the minute,etc. For example, I can set up a scipt that backs up a system, ./backup.sh, 
   to run every week on monday at 1:00 and I would have weekly backups given that the computer is on at that time.

10. (see script)

2. Each host is pinging all of the other hosts that it can reach : In this case, all of the hosts are connected to one switch, so it pings
   all other hosts except for itself. 
3. 'iperf' runs at 30 Gbits/second.
4a. There are 5 requests, and as a result there are 5 of_packet_in displayed on wireshark. 
 b. The source is '10.0.0.2' and the destination is '10.0.0.4' , which are the IP addresses assigned to the hosts.
   using the fileter does not yield any results using the filter 'of'.
 c. There are 57 entries, meaning that there are ~14 entries per ping. The entries are either of 'request' or reply'.
